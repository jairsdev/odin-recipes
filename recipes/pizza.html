        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pizza is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with 
        tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, vegetables, meat, ham, etc.), 
        which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.
        A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo. <a href="https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza">Wikipedia</a></p>
